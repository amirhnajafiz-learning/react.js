# CSSH

This project is a simplified implementation of SSH, developed in C++. Its purpose is to utilize processes and subprocesses to provide users with access to a shell and facilitate data transfer using symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, similar to how SSH operates when connecting users to remote servers.

## Server

Command `cssh ip:port -p password`.

## Client

Command `cssh user@ip:port -p password -f public-key`.

## Cryptography

- Symmetric: Uses the input password with the AES algorithm.
- Asymmetric: Uses public and private keys generated by ssh-keygen and the RSA algorithm.

## TODO

- [X] Add client handler in server side
- [X] Run `ls` command for each connection and return the response
- [X] Create a client that accepts input messages and sends them to server
- [X] Make the command execution dynamic in server
- [ ] Secure messages using AES and a password in server config
- [ ] Secure messages using RSA using client and server keys
