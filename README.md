# CSSH

This project is a simplified implementation of SSH, developed in C++. Its purpose is to utilize processes and subprocesses to provide users with access to a shell and facilitate data transfer using symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, similar to how SSH operates when connecting users to remote servers.

## Server

Command `cssh ip:port -p password`.

## Client

Command `cssh user@ip:port -p password -f public-key`.

## Cryptography

- Symmetric: Uses the input password with the AES algorithm.
- Asymmetric: Uses public and private keys generated by ssh-keygen and the RSA algorithm.
