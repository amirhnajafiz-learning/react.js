# CSSH
This project is a clone of SSH, created using the C programming language. The goal is to use processes and subprocesses to open a shell for users and transfer data using both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.

## Server
The server uses the fork command to connect user sockets to a process. After that, it opens a new shell to receive user commands and execute them.

## Client
The client takes an input like `ssh root@127.0.0.1`, which includes the address and username. Then, the user uses a password or a private key to encrypt their input data.

## Cryptography
Symmetric: Uses the input password with the AES algorithm.
Asymmetric: Uses public and private keys generated by ssh-keygen and the RSA algorithm.
